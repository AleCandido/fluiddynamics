# Resources

General open resources for learning and doing computational fluid dynamics.

All the content is mostly in python because of my personal bias.

## Learning

- [`pyro`](http://python-hydro.github.io/pyro2/): `pyro` is a simple framework for
  implementing and playing with hydrodynamics solvers. It is designed to
  provide a tutorial for students in computational astrophysics (and
  hydrodynamics in general).

  It is a part of the [Open Astrophysics Bookshelf](http://open-astrophysics-bookshelf.github.io/)

- [CFD Python: 12 steps to Navier-Stokes](https://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/)

## Papers

- [_Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics and Magnetohydrodynamics_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1885): formal introduction
- [_Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics: Things I wish my mother taught me_](https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.1259): informal introduction

## Frameworks

- [**PHANTOM**](https://phantomsph.bitbucket.io/#home): well-known by the
  readers
- [**fluidity**](https://fluidityproject.github.io/): a generic fluid dynamics
  framework
- [**FluidDyn**](https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): an open-source
  framework, particularly interesting
  [`fluidsim`](https://fluidsim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), you can install with
  just `pip`
- [**PySPH**](https://pysph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): another python framework
  for working with SPH sims
